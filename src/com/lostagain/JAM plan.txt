AR/Hololens/etc adventure game?

- Start simple (another Meryll game)
- One room
- Like "wants a cookie" use a simple concept
- Take advantage of perspective with AR. Make the player have to "look around" to find things hidden under things.
- Posssibly a "floor is lava" scanario. Somehow Meryll has caused litteral lava to envolope the room. Maybe make fun that this is never
explained how it happens. She just mentioned "the accident" "a small mistake"
- Her sister, still watching tv, is completely oblivious to the floor now being litteral lava.
- You have to drain the lava somehow? or solidify it?
